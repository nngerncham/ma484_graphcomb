\begin{frame}{Diameter on fixed $p$ random graphs is 2 w.h.p.}
    \begin{theorem}
        Let \(G(n, p)\) be a random graph of order $n$ and each edge appears with fixed probability $p \in (0, 1)$. 
        Then, \(\diam(G) \leq 2\) w.h.p.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let \(G(n, p)\) be a random graph of order $n$ and each edge appears with fixed probability $p \in (0, 1)$. 
        Then, every pair of distinct vertices $u, v$ have shared neighborhood w.h.p.
    \end{lemma}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Diameter on fixed $p$ random graphs is 2 w.h.p. --- Proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
        Define a random variable $X_{u, v}$ to be 1 if $N(u) \cap N(v) = \emptyset$ and 0 otherwise and define $X$ to be the sum of all $X_{u, v}$'s. Note that the probability that two vertices share no common neighbor is
        \[ \Pr{N(u) \cap N(v) = \emptyset} = (1-p^2)^{n-2} \]
        where $p^2$ is the probability that $u$ and $v$ pick the same neighbor where there are $n-2$ of such possibilities.
        By Markov's Inequality, we have
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \Pr{X \geq 1} \leq \Ex{X}
                          = \binom{n}{2}(1-p^2)^{n-2} \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty \qquad \text{[SageMath verified]}
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        Since $\Pr{X < 1} = 1 - \Pr{X \geq 1}$, the claim of the lemma satisfies w.h.p.
    \end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Diameter on fixed $p$ random graphs is 2 w.h.p. --- Proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem]
        Note that the probability that $\diam(G) \leq 2$ is the same as the probability that every pair of distinct vertices $u, v$ are adjacent or share a common neighbor. Hence, the probability that every distinct pair of vertices share a common neighbor is a lower bound for $\Pr{\diam(G) \leq 2}$.

        Let $X$ be the number of pairs of distinct vertices that do not share neighbors. We can conclude that
        \[ \Pr{\diam(G) \leq 2} \geq \Pr{X < 1} \to 1 \text{ as } n \to \infty \]
        Therefore, the diameter of random graph $G(n, p)$ with fixed $p$ is at most 2 w.h.p.
    \end{proof}
