\begin{frame}{Binary Search Tree Theorem}
    \begin{theorem}
        A binary search tree constructed on a permutation of $[n]$ has height $\Theta(\log n)$ w.h.p.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proofs}
        Indeed, it is straightforward to show that for any BST of $n$ nodes, its height is $\Omega(\log n)$ as the \textit{best case} is when the tree is complete (maybe except the lowest level). That is, 
    \end{proofs}
