\begin{theorem}
  For every graph \(G\), 
  \begin{displaymath}
    \kappa(G) \leq \lambda(G) \leq \delta(G)
  \end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  First, we will show that \(\lambda(G) \leq \delta(G)\). Let
  \(v\) be a vertex of \(G\) with minimum degree \(\delta(G)\).
  Notice that the edges incident to \(v\) is an edge cut of
  \(G\).

  Now, we will show that \(\kappa(G) \leq \lambda(G)\). Let
  \(G_1\) be the set of vertices
\end{proof}
