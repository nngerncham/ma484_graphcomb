\question For a simple planar graph \(G\) and \(W \subseteq
V(G)\) with \(|W| = k \geq 3\) (and \(|V|=n\)), show that
\[ \sum_{x \in W} d(x) \leq 2n + 6 k - 16 \]

\begin{solution}
  Consider the subgraph of \(G\) induced by \(W\); \(G' = G[W]\). Since \(G'\)
  is a subgraph of a planar graph, the sum of the degree of vertices in \(W\) in
  \(G'\) (neighborhoods could be different from \(G\)) must satisfy
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{x \in W} \deg_{G'} x = 2|E(G')| \leq 2(3k - 6) = 6k - 12
    \label{eq:p4-1}
  \end{equation}

  Since edges in \(G'\) does not make up every edge that every
  vertex in \(W\) may be incident to. What remains are edges between \(W\) and
  \(W \setminus G\). Now, consider the subgraph \(G''\) where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(V(G'')\) are vertices of \(W\) that are adjacent to some
      vertex in \(G \setminus W\) and vice versa
    \item \(E(G'')\) are the edges of vertices in \(W\) that are incident to
      some vertex in \(G \setminus W\)
  \end{itemize}
  Observe that \(G''\) is a bipartite graph by construction since we pick only
  edges of \(W\) that are incident to some vertex in \(G \setminus W\). As a
  result, every face in \(G''\) must be adjacent to \(\geq4\) edges.
  Consequently, we have that
  \[ 4F_{G''} \leq 2E_{G''} \]
  Using The Euler Identity to expand \(F(G'')\), we have
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      2|F(G'')| &\leq |E(G'')| \\
      2(2 - |V(G'')| + |E(G'')|) &\leq |E(G'')| \\ 
      4 - 2|V(G'')| + 2|E(G'')| &\leq |E(G'')| \\ 
      |E(G'')| &\leq 2|V(G'')| - 4 \\
              &\leq 2n - 4
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:p4-2}
  \end{equation}
  where the last inequality is obtained by the fact that \(G''\) can only be
  made up of vertices of \(G\), of which there are \(n\) many.

  Putting Equations \ref{eq:p4-1} and \ref{eq:p4-2} together, we finally have
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \sum_{x \in W} \deg x &= \left(\sum_{x \in W} \deg_{G'} x\right) + |E(G'')| \\
                            &\leq (6k - 12) + (2n - 4) \\
                            &= 2n + 6k - 16
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  Therefore, the claim in the problem statement satisfies.
\end{solution}
