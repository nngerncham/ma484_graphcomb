\question For every \(k \geq 1\), find a threshold function for
\(\{G \mid \Delta(G) \geq k\}\).

\begin{solution}
  The probability of a random graph \(G(n, p)\) having maximum
  degree at least \(k\) is the same as the probability that a star
  with \(k\) leaves is a subgraph of \(G\). This is given by
\end{solution}
