\question Show that, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph in which 
\[
  \deg(x)+\deg(y) \geq n-1 \quad
  \text{for all non-adjacent $x, y \in V(G)$,} 
\]
then $\lambda(G)=\delta(G)$.

\begin{solution}
  Recall that if \(G\) is a graph of order \(n\) such
  that \(\deg x + \deg y \geq n-1\) for every non-adjacent vertices \(x, y\),
  then \(G\) is connected and \(\diam(G) \leq 2\).

  Suppose that \(X\) is a minimal edge-cut where the vertices of \(G - X\) are
  separated into sets \(A\) and \(B\).
  Without loss of generality, we also assume that \(A\) is adjacent
  to some vertex of \(B\) in \(G\).
  Otherwise, there must be \(a \in A\) such 
  that for each \(b \in B\), there is a path \(a - c - b\) for some \(c \in 
  A\) (or \(a\) would already be adjacent to \(c \in B\)) since \(\diam(G) \leq
  2\). Then, this implies that every vertex in \(B\) is adjacent to some vertex 
  in \(A\). In that case, we can just swap the notation of \(A\) and \(B\).

  Consequently, every vertex of \(A\) is incident to some edge(s) in \(X\) 
  and it follows that \(|X| \geq |A|\) (since every \(a \in A\) can be 
  incident to more than one edge in \(X\)).

  Since each vertex \(a \in A\) can be adjacent to at most \(|A| - 1\) in
  \(G[A]\) (the disconnected component in \(G-X\)), each \(a \in A\)
  would be incident to at least \( \delta(G) - |A| + 1 \)
  edges in \(X\). Hence, it follows that 
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      |X| \geq |A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1)
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  Now, notice that \(1 \leq |A| \leq \delta(G)\). If \(|A| < 1\), then the
  vertices of \(G\) is not split into two groups and \(X\) is not an edge-cut.
  Similarly, \(|A| \leq |X| \leq \delta(G)\) for the second half or the
  inequality.
  Using Calculus, we can tell that \(|A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1)\) has critical
  points at \(|A| = 1, \frac{\delta(G)+1}{2}, \delta(G)\) with values
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      &|A| = 1,
      && |A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1) = \delta(G) \\
      &|A| = \frac{\delta(G)}{2},
      && |A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1) = \frac{\delta(G)^2 + 2\delta + 1}{4} \\
      &|A| = \delta(G),
      && |A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1) = \delta(G)
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  We can see that \(|A|(\delta(G) - |A| + 1)\) achieves its minimum
  value of \(\delta(G)\) at the bounds: \(|A| = 1, \delta(G)\). Hence, we have
  that \(\delta(G) \leq |X| = \lambda(G) \leq \delta(G)\). Therefore, we can
  conclude that \(\lambda(G) = \delta(G)\).
\end{solution}
