  Find the number of spanning trees in $K_{2,1}, K_{2,2}, K_{2,3}, K_{2,4}$.
  How many spanning trees has $K_{2, s}, s \geq 1$?

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For \(K_{2, 1}\), there is 1 spanning tree
      \item For \(K_{2, 2}\), there are 4 spanning trees
      \item For \(K_{2, 3}\), there are 12 spanning trees
      \item For \(K_{2, 4}\), there are 32 spanning trees 
    \end{itemize}

    In the general case \(K_{2, s}\) for \(s \geq 1\), we have 
    \[ \sum_{i=1}^s i \cdot \binom{s}{i} = 2^{s-1}s \]
    where the closed form is obtained by SageMath (my beloved). Namely, this
    summation is obtained as follows. 

    Let us denote the vertices on the \textit{left side} of the bipartite
    graph as \(a\) and \(b\). For each term of the summation---for some
    value of \(i\) in the range specified---we first identify how many ways
    we can connect \(a\) to \(i\) vertices on the \textit{right side} of the
    graph. This is computed by \(\binom{s}{i}\). Then, we connect \(b\) to
    the remaining vertices. To ensure that the graph is connected, we can 
    connect \(b\) to any one of the \(i\) vertices in that is adjacent to
    \(a\). Thus, we obtain the \(i \cdot \binom{s}{i}\) in each term. Then,
    we simply sum all the possible number of vertices \(a\) can be adjacent
    to: \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, s\).
  \end{solution}
