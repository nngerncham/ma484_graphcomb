\question
  Write the programs to perform a bijective mapping between the labelled trees and Pr端fer's codes.
  \begin{parts}
    \part \textit{Program \#1}

        Input: labelled tree $H$ (Use any data structure for the tree as you 
        like) \\
        Output: Pr端fer's codes that corresponding to $H$.

      \part \textit{Program \#2}

        Input: Pr端fer's codes \\ 
        Output: labelled tree $H$ that corresponding to the code.

      \part \textit{Program \#3}

        Input: number of vertices $n, n \geq 3$ \\ 
        Output: the set of all Pr端fer's codes of length $n-2$ and its 
        corresponding labelled tree of $n$ vertices.
  \end{parts}
  Verify by hand for $n=3,4$ that Program \#3 is indeed a bijective map.
