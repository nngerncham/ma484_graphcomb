\question
  Write the programs to perform a bijective mapping between the labelled trees and Pr端fer's codes.
  \begin{parts}
    \part
      Input: labelled tree $H$ (Use any data structure for the tree as you like)
      Output: Pr端fer's codes that corresponding to $H$.
    \part
      Input: Pr端fer's codes
      Output: labelled tree $H$ that corresponding to the code.
    \part
      Input: number of vertices $n, n \geq 3$
      Output: the set of all Pr端fer's codes of length $n-2$ and its corresponding
      labelled tree of $n$ vertices.
  \end{parts}
  Verify by hand for $n=3,4$ that Program \#3 is indeed a bijective map.
