    Let $G$ be a graph (not a multigraph). Show that at least two of its 
    vertices must have the same degree.

  % [Source of hint \cite{p2-1}]
  The possible degrees of a graph are \(\{0, 1,
  \ldots, n-1\}\). However, we cannot have graphs where there are vertices with
  0 degrees and \(n-1\) degrees in the same simple graph since having a degree
  of \(n-1\) means that that vertex is adjacent to every vertex in the graph.
  Thus, the degrees of the vertices of \(G\) must either belong to \(\{0, 1, 
  \ldots, n-2\}\) or \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\). Notice that, in both cases,
  there are \(n-1\) possible degrees while we have \(n\) vertices. Therefore, by
  the Pigeonhole Principle, we can conclude that there are at least two vertices
  that have the same degree.
