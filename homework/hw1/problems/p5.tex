\begin{hwproblem}{5}{
    Prove or disprove: if $u$ and $v$ are the only vertices of odd
    degree in a (not necessary connected) graph $G$ then $G$ contains a $u-v$ 
    path.
  }
  Assume that \(G\) is disconnected. Otherwise, there must already be a
  \(u-v\) path by the definition of a connected graph. We will show that \(u,
  v\) must belong in the same disconnected component. Assume to the contrary
  that \(u, v\) belongs in the components \(H_1, H_2\), respectively
  Since \(u\) and \(v\) are the only two vertices with odd degrees, we have 
  that the sum of degrees of vertices in each subgraph would come out to be odd.
  This is a contradiction since the sum of degrees of vertices in a graph must
  be even. Thus, \(u, v\) must belong in the same connected component and there
  is always a path between them.
