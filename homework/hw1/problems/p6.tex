\begin{hwproblem}{6}{
    Let $G$ be a graph containing a cycle $C$, and assume that $G$
    contains a path of length at least $k$ between two vertices of $C$. Show 
    that $G$ contains a cycle of length at least $\sqrt{k}$. Is this best 
    possible?
  }
  Let \(c = |V(C)|\) where \(V(C) = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_c\}\) are the 
  vertices of \(G\) that shows up in \(C\). Also, let \(P\) refer to the path of
  length \(k\) between two vertices of \(C\) where \(V(P) = \{v_i, p_1, p_2,
  ..., p_{k-2}, v_j\}\) are its vertices and \(v_i, v_j \in V(C)\) that \(P\)
  connects.

  Claim that we can always form a cycle \(C'\) of length at least \(k\) in 
  \(G\). 

  Consequently, the sharpest lower bound for the length of cycle would be 
  \(k\) instead of \(\sqrt{k}\) since we can always form a cycle that includes
  \(P\) in it.
