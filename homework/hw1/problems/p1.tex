\begin{hwproblem}{1}{
  Prove that if the numbers $1,2, \ldots, 12$ are randomly positioned around a 
  circle, then some set of three consecutively positioned numbers must have a 
  sum of at least 20 .
  }

  Assume to the contrary that, once positioned into a circle, there is no three
  consecutive numbers with a sum of at least 20. Notice the following adjacency
  constraints. These constraints are due to the fact that, regardless of the
  third number, these numbers being adjacent to each other would already add up
  to at least 20.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 12 cannot be adjacent to 8, 9, 10, 11
    \item 11 cannot be adjacent to 9, 10, 12
    \item 10 cannot be adjacent to 11, 12
    \item 9 cannot be adjacent to 11, 12
    \item 8 cannot be adjacent to 12
  \end{itemize}
  So, we would need to place them apart from each other so that our
  assumption holds. Notice also that, ignoring combinations, we have the
  following surrounding constraint.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 12 can only be surrounded by numbers 7 or lower
    \item 11 can only be surrounded by numbers 8 or lower
    \item 10 can only be surrounded by numbers 9 or lower
    \item 9 can only be surrounded by numbers 10 or lower
    \item 8 can only be surrounded by numbers 11 or lower
    \item The rest of the numbers can be surrounded by any number
  \end{itemize}
