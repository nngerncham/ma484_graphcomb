\question A connected bipartite graph \(G\) has partite sets 
\(U\) and \(W\), where \(|U| = |W| = \) \(k \geq 2\). Prove that
if every two vertices of \(U\) have distinct degrees in \(G\),
then \(G\) contains a perfect matching.

\begin{solution}
  We will show that the marriage condition satisfies. Let \(S
  \subseteq U\). We will show that \(|S| \leq |N(S)|\). Suppose
  that \(|S| = l\). We claim that \(\max_{s \in S} \deg s \geq 
  l\). Then, we would have that 
  \[
    |N(S)| \geq \max_{s \in S} \deg s \geq l = |S|
  \]
  Since the marriage condition satisfies, we have that there
  exists a perfect matching in \(G\) by The Marriage Theorem.
  Hence, what is left is for us to prove our claim.

  First, notice that the possible degrees of vertices in \(U\),
  and consequently vertices in \(S\), are \(\{1, 2, \ldots, l,
  \ldots, k-1\}\). Assume to the contrary that \(\max_{s \in S}
  \deg s < l\). Then, the degrees in \(S\) would be \(1, 2,
  \ldots, l-1\). Since there are \(l\) vertices in \(S\), there
  must be at least two vertices with the same degree. This is a
  contradiction since every vertex of \(U\) has a distinct
  degree. Therefore, it must be that the maximum degree in \(S\)
  must be at least \(l\).
\end{solution}
