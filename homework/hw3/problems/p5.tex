\question Let \(G\) be connected graph of order \(n\) where
\(\Delta(G)+\delta(G) \geq n-2\). Show that \(\operatorname{diam}
(G) \leq 4\).

\begin{solution}
  We will show that for every pair of distinct vertices \(u, v\),
  \(d(u, v) \leq 4\). Let \(x\) be the vertex of maximum degree.
  We will show the different cases possible for which 
  neighborhood \(u, v\) belongs to. Note that we will consider
  these cases without loss of generality and assume that \(u\) is
  the start of the path \(u \to v\).

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
    \item If \(u \in N(v)\), then they are adjacent and
      \(d(u, v) = 1\).
    \item If 
  \end{enumerate}
  % Claim that for every \(v \in V(G)\), we have that \(d(v, x)
  % \leq 2\). If this satisfies, then we can always route any two
  % vertices through \(x\), achieving distances of at most
  % \(2+2=4\).
  % If \(v \in N(x)\), then we are done and \(d(v, x) = 1\).

  % Otherwise, we would have that \(v \notin N(x)\).
  % % Notice that \(\deg v + \deg x < n\).
  % For simplicity's sake, we say that any vertex is adjacent to
  % itself even though there is no edge to itself. 
  % Recall that \(\deg x = \Delta\). Then, there are \(n - (\Delta
  % + 1)\) vertices not adjacent to \(x\) where \(\Delta\) is every
  % neighbor of \(x\) and 1 is \(x\) itself. Consider the
  % following. Since \(\Delta + \delta \geq n-2\), it follows that
  % \(\Delta \geq n - \delta - 2\). Then, the number of vertices
  % not adjacent to \(x\) is
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
    % n - (\Delta + 1) 
    %   &\geq n - (n - \delta - 2 + 1) \\
    %   &= \delta + 1
    \delta \geq n - \Delta - 2
  \end{aligned}
  \]

  Therefore, we can conclude that for any connected graph \(G\)
  of order \(n\) where \(\Delta(G) + \delta(G) \geq n-2\),
  \(\diam(G) \leq 4\) satisfies. 
\end{solution}
