  ABSTRACT = {Suppose ai indicates the number of orbits of size i in graph G. A
              new counting polynomial, namely an orbit polynomial, is defined as
              OG(x) = âˆ‘i aixi. Its modified version is obtained by subtracting
              the orbit polynomial from 1. In the present paper, we studied the
              conditions under which an integer polynomial can arise as an orbit
              polynomial of a graph. Additionally, we surveyed graphs with a
              small number of orbits and characterized several classes of graphs
              with respect to their orbit polynomials.},
