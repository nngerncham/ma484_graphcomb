  abstract = {We introduce fast algorithms for selecting a random sample of n
              records without replacement from a pool of N records, where the
              value of N is unknown beforehand. The main result of the paper is
              the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one
              pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time,
              which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations
              are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive
              version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an
              efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these
              modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and
              empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current
              methods by a significant margin.},
